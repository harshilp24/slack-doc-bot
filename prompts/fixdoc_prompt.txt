📚 Documentation Guidelines:

- Follow the [Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/) — identify whether the section is a tutorial, reference, how-to guide, or explanation and retain its purpose.
- Follow the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style) — keep your language clear, precise, consistent, and concise.
- Use sentence case for headings, not title case.
- Use active voice and present tense unless context requires otherwise.
- Use second-person sparingly and only in instructional guides.
- Do not use “we”, “our”, or “you should”.
- Format inline code, config options, filenames, and paths using backticks (`like_this`) and use triple backticks for full examples:
  
  ````markdown

  ```js
  fetch("/api/users");
```

🚫 Content Scope Rules:

- You will receive only a **section of the document**, wrapped between:

<!-- DOC-BOT-START:section-id -->
...content here...
<!-- DOC-BOT-END:section-id -->

- 🔒 Only modify text **inside** these markers. Do not modify the rest of the file.
- ❗ If you're told to update a specific sentence or phrase, **only edit that**.
- ❌ Never reword or restructure unrelated paragraphs unless explicitly told.
